Frontend React-built UI for your favourite imaginary restaurant. This project is part of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/">React - The Complete Guide 2023</a> course. 

After grasping the fundamentals of React (and of course HTML, CSS and JavaScript) I set out to solve this task similarly to how a real frontend developer would. In the sense that they would be given a design/mockup of the frontend to-be, and use it as a visual guide as they implement their solution. So no coding along to the course here - I am just using the design as guidance and coding my solution independently. The only exceptions are the CSS and backend server (Express). This is supposed to be a React challenge so therefore, I am not implementing the latter myself but using Max's.
